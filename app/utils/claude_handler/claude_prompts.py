Your task:

- Analyze the above job posting HTML content for me and determine if it's a SINGLE job posting detail page.

        "requirements": [],
        "location": "",
        "other_additional_details": ""
    }}
}}

VERY IMPORTANT: 
1. Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object shown above with the appropriate fields filled in.
2. Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or additional text before or after the JSON.
3. Make sure all string values are properly escaped, especially for quotation marks, backslashes, and newlines.
4. If any field isn't found from job posting html, use an empty string "" or empty array [] as appropriate.
